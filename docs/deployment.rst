Deployment of GeoEDF on a cyberinfrastructure
=============================================

Work is currently in progress on developing Kubernetes solutions for deploying GeoEDF in a standalone fashion independent 
of any CI platform. Instructions will be provided here when available. Meanwhile, we recommend users to use the GeoEDF 
workflow engine on the MyGeoHub science gateway.
